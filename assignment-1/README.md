üß© Assignment 1 ‚Äî S3 Bucket with IP Restriction and SSE-KMS Encryption

üß† **Objective**
**Create a secure S3 bucket that:**

  1. Is private (no public access),
  
  2. Is only accessible from specific IP addresses,
  
  3. Uses SSE-KMS encryption with a customer-managed KMS key,
  
  4. Has enforced encryption through bucket policies.

‚öôÔ∏è **Implementation Overview**

**Tools Used**: Terraform, AWS CLI, KMS, S3

Steps Performed:

  1. Created a customer-managed KMS key
  
     i. Type: Symmetric
      
     ii. Usage: ENCRYPT_DECRYPT
      
     iii. Key rotation enabled for best practices.
  
  2. Created an alias alias/s3encryptionkey for easier key reference.
  
  3. Created an S3 bucket using Terraform.
  
  4. Applied default bucket encryption using the KMS key (SSE-KMS).
  
  5. Added bucket policy to:
  
      i. Deny uploads without encryption headers,
      
      ii. Restrict access to specific IPs.
  
  6. Tested manually using AWS CLI:
```
aws s3 cp testfile.txt s3://<bucket-name>/ --sse aws:kms --sse-kms-key-id alias/s3encryptionkey
aws s3api head-object --bucket <bucket-name> --key testfile.txt --query ServerSideEncryption
```

Verified output: "aws:kms"

        Effect    = "Deny"
        Principal = "*"
        Action    = "s3:PutObject"
        Resource  = "${aws_s3_bucket.secure_bucket.arn}/*"
        Condition = {
          StringNotEquals = {
            "s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption" = "aws:kms"

        }
      }

üß© Verification

‚úÖ Bucket created successfully
‚úÖ File uploads encrypted automatically
‚úÖ Access denied from non-whitelisted IPs
‚úÖ Policy prevents unencrypted uploads

**Screenshots**

1. **When trying to list contents of S3 bucket from IP which is not allowed, it is throwing error of AccessDenied.**

2. **When trying to list contents of S3 bucket from IP which is allowed, it is showing exit code 0 which is success. Bucket was empty when testing was done that's why exit code 0 was there.**
