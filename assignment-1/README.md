üß© Assignment 1 ‚Äî S3 Bucket with IP Restriction and SSE-KMS Encryption

üß† **Objective**
**Create a secure S3 bucket that:**

  1. Is private (no public access),
  
  2. Is only accessible from specific IP addresses,
  
  3. Uses SSE-KMS encryption with a customer-managed KMS key,
  
  4. Has enforced encryption through bucket policies.

‚öôÔ∏è **Implementation Overview**

**Tools Used**: Terraform, AWS CLI, KMS, S3

Steps Performed:

  1. Created a customer-managed KMS key
  
     i. Type: Symmetric
      
     ii. Usage: ENCRYPT_DECRYPT
      
     iii. Key rotation enabled for best practices.
  
  2. Created an alias alias/s3encryptionkey for easier key reference.
  
  3. Created an S3 bucket using Terraform.
  
  4. Applied default bucket encryption using the KMS key (SSE-KMS).
  
  5. Added bucket policy to:
  
      i. Deny uploads without encryption headers,
      
      ii. Restrict access to specific IPs.
  
  6. Tested manually using AWS CLI:
```
aws s3 cp testfile.txt s3://<bucket-name>/ --sse aws:kms --sse-kms-key-id alias/s3encryptionkey
aws s3api head-object --bucket <bucket-name> --key testfile.txt --query ServerSideEncryption
```

Verified output: "aws:kms"

üß© Verification

‚úÖ Bucket created successfully
‚úÖ File uploads encrypted automatically
‚úÖ Access denied from non-whitelisted IPs
‚úÖ Policy prevents unencrypted uploads

**Deliverables**:

1. Public IP Used: Public IP of the EC2 instance on which it was running at that time.
2. Explanation: IP restriction is applied using AWS recource "aws_s3_bucket_policy" in terraform with "AllowGetPutFromMyIP" to allow GET,PUT,LIST option from my public IP and "DenyAllExceptFromMyIP" to deny access any kind of access to the S3 bucket created if being accessed from any IP apart from my public IP. Made the S3 bucket private with resource "aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block" and configured the encryption part with the resource named "server_side_encryption_configuration".

**Screenshots**

1. **When trying to list contents of S3 bucket from IP which is not allowed, it is throwing error of AccessDenied.**

2. **When trying to list contents of S3 bucket from IP which is allowed, it is showing exit code 0 which is success. Bucket was empty when testing was done that's why exit code 0 was there.**
